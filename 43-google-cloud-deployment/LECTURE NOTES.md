### Learning Goal 1: Use `npm build` to create an optimized react build

##### Timestamp: _

##### Demonstrate

* In Node: 

  * `app.use(express.static('public'))`

* In Rails

  * ```
    get '*path', to: "application#react_app", constraints: ->(request) do
    	!request.xhr? && request.format.html?
    end
    ```

  * ```
    def react_app
    	render :file => 'public/index.html'
    end
    ```

## Automated Deployment

- Install nodemon
- Install child-process-promise
- Add a handler for the `/deploy` endpoint which uses the child-process-promise.exec function to pull updates to the google
- Add `http://<your IP>/deploy` as a GitHub web hook for the repository you want to autodeploy from.
