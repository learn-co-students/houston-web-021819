# JavaScript: Object Orientation

### Learning Goals

- Implement a class with the `class` and `constructor` keywords, and instantiate it with the  `new` keyword

- Determine the value of `this` based on how a function is defined and invoked 

- Change the value of `this` within a function using the arrow-function syntax

- Explain when and why to use class methods


### Activation

##### We want multiple characters on screen



### Learning Goal 1: Implement a class with the `class` and `constructor` keywords, and instantiate it with the  `new` keyword

#### Demonstrate:

* Classes are similar to the syntax we saw in ruby
* Basic refactor of our character logic into a class
* Using `new` to instantiate mutliple characters 
* Passing arguments with `new` to the constructor to change the position

#### Reinforce:

* Driver / Navigator: Add an option for image

#### Check for Understanding: 

* Kahoot



### Learning Goal 2: Determine the value of `this` based on how a function is defined and invoked

#### Demonstrate:

* That `this` is whatever object the current method belongs to
* That `this` is the current instance, or a "specific" character
* Refactoring our Character class to rely on `this`
* How `this` can change value if the function is made a method of another object

#### Reinforce:

* Critical Analysis: What will the value of `this` be when I reassign a method from Bobby to Eli?

#### Check for Understanding: 

* Kahoot



> Break



### Learning Goal 3: Change the value of `this` within a function using the arrow-function syntax

#### Demonstrate:

* Changing our `setInterval` callback to accept an arrow function
* How arrow functions are inherintly bound to whatever `this` was where they were defined 

#### Reinforce:

* Driver / Navigator: Adding the ability to remove a character when it is clicked
  * Make them describe the arrow function syntax!!!

#### Check for Understanding: 

* Kahoot



### Learning Goal 4: Explain when and why to use class methods

#### Demonstrate:

* We can use `static` (class) methods for behavior which takes into account **all** characters
* Implement a "closest" 

#### Reinforce:

* Driver / Navigator: Implement a "farthest" method

#### Check for Understanding: 

* Classify **one** of the methods below as an instance method or as a class method using the right most column. Then, replace the arrow in the leftmost column with either a "." for class methods or a "#" for instance methods
